# Test Project (Laravel + Vue)

This is a test project for the Full-Stack Developer position that I've recentlly applied to.

Backend part of the project is built using Laravel and provides administrators with a way to manage products sold on their E-Shop. Second part of the project, Frontend part, consists from a basic E-Shop that lists currently active products, etc.

## Testing

To test the project execute the following from the "frontend" directory.

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```
